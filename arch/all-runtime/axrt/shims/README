Why shims and not proxy functions in AxRT libraries?

Let's take fopen as example. fopen can receive and Amiga-like path and has
to translate it to host system path. This can be done by exposing fopen
in stdc.library, having it do the translation, having it dlopen libc.so
and making a call to host fopen. This will work for all AxRT side code as
stdc.library will generate a linklib which will provide fopen stub for
all AxRT binaries. This will however not work for any host-side libraries
that are used by the AxRT binary, for example libpng.so.

Having a shim which overwrites the GOT/PLT fopen entry works for both
AxRT-side and host-side libraries.
